Parses a tiny subset* of HTML into a drawable data structure. Because UIWebView is way too slow, and you can't "draw" NSAttributedStrings the same way as NSStrings (drawInPoint: drawInRect: etc), and NSAttributedStrings lack useful things such as links and image rendering.

* Supported tags/attributes:
- b
- a
- i
- br

Todo:
- trim adjacent spaces in the same manner as HTML renderers
- delegate link callbacks
- images
-- delegate image callbacks
- blockquote
- underline
- strikethrough

Nice to have:
- font tags, with attributes such as font size, color
- image align attribute
